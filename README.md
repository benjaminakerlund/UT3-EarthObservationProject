Guide for python installation:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-linux/

NOTE! Using venv from the guide above.

Running project within venv:
	source venv/bin/activate
	deactivate

Could be a good idea to setup a shell script to run it easier in the future?

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages using pip:
	pip install package_name
